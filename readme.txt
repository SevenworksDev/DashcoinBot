IMPORTANT! Configure what you want in main.py and autoprofilepost.py

Setup using these commands
pip install fuckit requests==2.28.2
python autoprofilepost.py

Run using this command
python main.py




If python isnt found, use py for everything instead.
If you get an error about missing modules, install it via "pip install (missing link i mean module here)"
If you get an error about chunked() or anything else major, refer to below.
If you fuck something up, You're a dumbass!
If you didnt configure main.py and autoprofilepost.py, Look above.
